# Diabetes Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning project that predicts whether a person is **diabetic or non-diabetic** based on medical input parameters. The model analyzes health-related data and provides an accurate prediction to assist in early detection and awareness of diabetes.

This project demonstrates the practical use of machine learning in the healthcare domain.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires early diagnosis for effective management. Manual diagnosis can be time-consuming and may vary based on experience. This project aims to build a data-driven system that can help predict diabetes using machine learning techniques.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach
- Collect and preprocess medical data
- Analyze numerical health features
- Train a machine learning classification model
- Predict whether the patient is diabetic or not

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains medical attributes such as:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

**Target Variable:**
- `1` → Diabetic  
- `0` → Non-Diabetic  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Handle missing values and scale features
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train the machine learning model
5. Provide input values
6. Get prediction: **Diabetic or Not Diabetic**

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Diabetes-Prediction-System.git
````

2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run all cells to train and test the model
